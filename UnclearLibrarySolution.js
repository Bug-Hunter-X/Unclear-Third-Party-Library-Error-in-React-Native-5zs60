The solution often involves carefully reviewing the versions of your third-party libraries and their dependencies. You can try these steps:

1. **Update all libraries:** Ensure all libraries are updated to their latest compatible versions. Use `yarn upgrade` or `npm update`.
2. **Check package.json:** Carefully review your `package.json` file to check for any conflicting dependencies or versions. Try resolving conflicts manually by specifying exact versions.
3. **Use a dependency management tool:** Tools like `yarn` or `npm` provide dependency management features to help with conflict resolution.
4. **Check library documentation:** Read the documentation of any problematic third-party library. It might have specific compatibility requirements or known issues related to your React Native version.
5. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** Create a minimal project with only the necessary libraries to isolate the issue.
6. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve unexpected issues. Delete the `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` (or `package-lock.json`) files, and reinstall your dependencies.

Example of improved `package.json` (with version specifications):
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "^0.71.0",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^9.2.0",
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.17.11"
  }
}
```

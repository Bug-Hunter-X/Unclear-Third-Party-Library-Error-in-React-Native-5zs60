This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Native related to third-party library conflicts. The error message is often cryptic and doesn't directly pinpoint the problem. The solution involves careful library version management and dependency resolution.  The `UnclearLibraryError.js` file shows the problematic code, while `UnclearLibrarySolution.js` provides a fix.
